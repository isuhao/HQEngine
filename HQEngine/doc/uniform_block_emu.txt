Uniform block emulation for Direct3D 9 and Old OpenGL (ES):
- Not support struct inside uniform block
- Each element of block (as well as row/col of matrix (based on row_major/column_major)) starts at next vector
- The preprocessor is still only able to detect single value array size, not constant expression .
- D3D9: 16 buffer slots for each shader stage
- GL: 36 buffer slots.
